### DeepSeek

* Mirth is the emotion of great, often lively, joy and amusement, expressed through laughter and cheerfulness. It is more than just happiness; it is happiness that is openly displayed and shared.
* **Expressive Joy:** Mirth is not a quiet, internal feeling. It implies an outward expression, most commonly through laughter, smiles, and merriment.
* **Lighthearted and Amused:** The joy associated with mirth is typically lighthearted, arising from fun, humor, or gaiety. It's the feeling you get from a good joke, a festive party, or a cheerful gathering.
* **A Literary Flavor:** While perfectly understandable, "mirth" is used more often in literary contexts than in everyday conversation. In modern speech, people are more likely to use words like "laughter," "merriment," "hilarity," or "glee." Using "mirth" can add a touch of elegance or specificity.
* In essence, **mirth** is the vibrant, audible, and visible manifestation of joy and amusement. It's the sound of happiness.
